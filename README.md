For this, you must have a raspberry pi 3 and a Sense Hat (https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/sense-hat/)

The code is in the "Heart.py" file

The code is composed of two sections :

The first is the "writing" of the picture (2 in this animation) with differents colors.

The second section is a loop showing pictures and wait a time beetween pictures. It's with this loop that the animation or "gif" is creates
